Regolith Theme
===
Regolith is my custom starter theme; which is responsive, Retina-ready, and mobile friendly! Regolith is based on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) and doesn't take things too far beyond Underscores, just adds a few hours to that "1000-Hour Head Start" to get you from 50% of a theme to 75%.

####Features

* **Templates Files:** Has all the basic markup and templates from Underscores that you need to get started quickly.
* **CSS Styling:** Regolith adds a bit more polish to Underscores, providing some basic styling, while still remaining very minimalist for easy customization.
* **Responsive:** A fixed maximum width for desktops that scales down fluidly for laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Retina-ready:** Includes no images in the design, only CSS and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons, for sharp looking websites at any screen resolution.
* **Mobile Friendly:** A lean, lightweight theme with minimal scripts and stylesheets to ensure a fast mobile view. Uses [Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com/) and good mobile styling for better mobile usability.
* **Highly Widgetized:** Includes many handy widget areas, such as in the header and 404 template, so that end users can manage their content everywhere on the site without editing the theme itself.
